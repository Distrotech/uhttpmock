uhttpmock
=========

uhttpmock is a project for mocking web service APIs which use HTTP or HTTPS. It
provides a library, libuhttpmock, which implements recording and playback of
HTTP request–response traces.

See the test programs in libuhttpmock/tests/ for simple examples of how to use
the code.

libuhttpmock’s API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.
